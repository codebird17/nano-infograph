- Each style dynamically enhances prompts with specific design instructions
- Enables consistent visual branding across generated infographs

### 3. **Base64 Image Processing**
- Extracts `inlineData` from Gemini's response parts

## Centrality to Application
Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is **essential** to our application - it transforms static YouTube transcripts into engaging visual content. Without Gemini's advanced image generation capabilities, our tool would be limited to text processing only. The model's ability to understand complex design requirements and generate professional-quality infographs makes visual storytelling accessible to everyone.
